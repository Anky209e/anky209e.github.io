# Using AWS Budgets

### An AWS budget is a tool for tracking a specified set of events so that when a preset threshold is approached or passed, an alert—perhaps an email—is triggered. You can create one of three budget types: 
* Cost budget to monitor costs being incurred against your account
* Usage budget to track particular categories of resource consumption
* Reservation budget to help you understand the status of any active EC2, RDS, Redshift, or Elasticache reserve instances you might have

# Setting Budgets

### The budget setup process has two parts:
* Set the terms of your budget—meaning, what it is that you’re tracking.
* Define how and when you want alerts sent.
